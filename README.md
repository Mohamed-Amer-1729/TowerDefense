# Tower Defense Game
This was my final CS2 Project which I coded with two other classmates. The premise of the project is to create a game where there is a main building in the middle of the screen being attacked by enemies spawning at the edges of the screen.
The player have a tower that enables him to shoot enemies, and walls to defend the main building. Workers fix the walls when they are damaged.
This project tested us heavily on our ability to use OOP, pointers, Qt Framework, and managing all of this to create a graphical program.
